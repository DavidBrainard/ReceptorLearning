 mdsj.jar: This file can be used to perform embeddings in java. We do not use these embeddings in the
           paper; rather we use Matlab's mdscale() function. However, if you do not have access to
           Matlab, you can use this library for embeddings in clojure (via the :embed option to the
           write-simulation function). This library is the MDSJ multidimensional scaling in java 
           library. The library is described in the citation below. Note that the license for this
